/*
ES6: Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function

ES6 provides a new syntax to help create objects, using the keyword class.
This is to be noted, that the class syntax is just a syntax, and not a full-fledged class based implementation 
of object oriented paradigm, unlike in languages like Java, or Python, or Ruby etc.
In ES5, we usually define a constructor function, and use the new keyword to instantiate an object.
```
var SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet){
  this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
}
var zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```
The class syntax simply replaces the constructor function creation:
```
class SpaceShuttle {
  constructor(targetPlanet){
    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
}
const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```
Notice that the class keyword declares a new function, and a constructor was added, which would be invoked when new 
is called - to create a new object.

Use class keyword and write a proper constructor to create the Vegetable class.
The Vegetable lets you create a vegetable object, with a property name, to be passed to constructor.

Test Cases:-
Passed
Vegetable should be a class with a defined constructor method.
Passed
class keyword was used.
Passed
Vegetable can be instantiated.
Passed
carrot.name should return carrot.
