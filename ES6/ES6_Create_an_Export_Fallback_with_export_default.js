/*
ES6: Create an Export Fallback with export default

In the export lesson, you learned about the syntax referred to as a named export.
This allowed you to make multiple functions and variables available for use in other files.
There is another export syntax you need to know, known as export default. Usually you will use this syntax 
if only one value is being exported from a file. It is also used to create a fallback value for a file or module.
Here is a quick example of export default:
```
export default function add(x,y) {
  return x + y;
}
```
Note: Since export default is used to declare a fallback value for a module or file, you can only have one 
value be a default export in each module or file. Additionally, you cannot use export default with var, let, or const
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following function should be the fallback value for the module. Please add the necessary code to do so.

Test Cases:-
Passed
Proper used of export fallback.
*/
//---------------------------------------------
"use strict";
export default function subtract(x,y) {return x - y;}
