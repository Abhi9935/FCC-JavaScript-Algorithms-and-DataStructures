/*
ES6: Import a Default Export

In the last challenge, you learned about export default and its uses. It is important to note that, 
to import a default export, you need to use a different import syntax.
In the following example, we have a function, add, that is the default export of a file, "math_functions". 
Here is how to import it:
```
import add from "math_functions";
add(5,4); //Will return 9
```
The syntax differs in one key place - the imported value, add, is not surrounded by curly braces, {}. 
Unlike exported values, the primary method of importing a default export is to simply write the value's name after import.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the following code, please import the default export, subtract, from the file "math_functions", 
found in the same directory as this file.

Test Cases:-
Passed
Properly imports export default method.
