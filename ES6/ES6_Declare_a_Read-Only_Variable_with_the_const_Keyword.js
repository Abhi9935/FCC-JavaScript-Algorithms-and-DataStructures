ES6: Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword

let is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.
const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned.
```
"use strict"
const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs"; // returns error
```
As you can see, trying to reassign a variable declared with const will throw an error. You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the const keyword. This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant. A common practice when naming constants is to use all uppercase letters, with words separated by an underscore.
Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const. Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices, meaning constants should be in all caps.

Test Cases:-
Passed
var does not exist in your code.
Passed
SENTENCE should be a constant variable declared with const.
Passed
i should be declared with let.
Passed
console.log should be changed to print the SENTENCE variable.
