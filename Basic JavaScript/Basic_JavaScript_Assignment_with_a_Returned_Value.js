/*
Basic JavaScript: Assignment with a Returned Value

If you'll recall from our discussion of Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, 
everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. 
This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

Assume we have pre-defined a function sum which adds two numbers together, then:
```
ourSum = sum(5, 12);
```
will call sum function, which returns a value of 17 and assigns it to ourSum variable.
Call the processArg function with an argument of 7 and assign its return value to the variable processed.

Test Cases:-
Passed
processed should have a value of 2
Passed
You should assign processArg to processed
*/
// Example
var changed = 0;

function change(num) {
  return (num + 5) / 3;
}

changed = change(10);

// Setup
var processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
}

// Only change code below this line
processed=processArg(7);
