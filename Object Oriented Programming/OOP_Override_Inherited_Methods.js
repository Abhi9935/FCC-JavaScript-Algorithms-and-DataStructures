/*
Object Oriented Programming: Override Inherited Methods

In previous lessons, you learned that an object can inherit its behavior 
(methods) from another object by cloning its prototype object:

ChildObject.prototype = Object.create(ParentObject.prototype);

Then the ChildObject received its own methods by chaining them onto its prototype:

ChildObject.prototype.methodName = function() {...};
It's possible to override an inherited method. It's done the same way - by adding 
a method to ChildObject.prototype using the same method name as the one to override.
Here's an example of Bird overriding the eat() method inherited from Animal:

```
function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "nom nom nom";
};
function Bird() { }

// Inherit all methods from Animal
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Bird.eat() overrides Animal.eat()
Bird.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "peck peck peck";
};
```
If you have an instance let duck = new Bird(); and you call duck.eat(), 
this is how JavaScript looks for the method on duckâ€™s prototype chain:

1. duck => Is eat() defined here? No.
2. Bird => Is eat() defined here? => Yes. Execute it and stop searching.
3. Animal => eat() is also defined, but JavaScript stopped searching before 
reaching this level.
4. Object => JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.
Override the fly() method for Penguin so that it returns "Alas, this is a flightless bird."

Test Cases:-
Passed
penguin.fly() should return the string "Alas, this is a flightless bird."
Passed
The bird.fly() method should return "I am flying!"

*/

function Bird() { }

Bird.prototype.fly = function() { 
    return "I am flying!"; 
};

function Penguin() { }
Penguin.prototype = Object.create(Bird.prototype);
Penguin.prototype.constructor = Penguin;

// Add your code below this line
Penguin.prototype.fly=function(){
    return  "Alas, this is a flightless bird.";
}
// Add your code above this line

let penguin = new Penguin();
console.log(penguin.fly());
